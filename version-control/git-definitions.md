# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is like saving code, on steriods. When you "save" you can revert to all your previous versions, work on the code while the "real code" isn't touched and it can help make it easier for multiple people to work on the code at the save time. I can't imagine how hard it would be to merge multiple coders work at the end of the week!

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is your save data, kinda. It's like if my little sister wanted to play grand theft auto on my awesome save slot but I don't want her to change my save data. The cool thing about git is that you can merge BOTH peoples progress instead of just an overwrite.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
Kinda like a restore point for your code. Same basic idea with your computer and you install a bunch of software. You need to have a good commit message in case something breaks and you need to track down what is wrong. 
* What is a merge conflict?
I am struggling to wrap my head around this one. I kinda get it, the idea is that if two people change the same part of the code, git won't know who is "right". In my grand theft auto example, if my sister wastes all my money, do I want to keep her low amount of money that she is trying to merge? or my high amount. Obviously my high amount, which is probably why git hasn't moved into the video game market.
