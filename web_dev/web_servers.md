9 major tenets of linux design philosophy
1.Small is Beautiful
2.Each Program Does One Thing Well
	I see this with using windows, well the inverse. Programs are increasly bloated 
	and with no good reason. Do you NEED a new version of word? No, but they need to sell it

Prototype as Soon as Possible
	This is a TDD philosophy too. Rush out something, so you can play with it instead of
	spending a lot of time making something people dont want
Use Shell Scripts to Increase Leverage and Portability
Choose Portability Over Efficiency
	compiled languages are fast, but not easy to change.
Store Data in Flat Text Files
Use Software Leverage
	Another aspect of software leverage is that good programmers write good code and great programmers borrow good code. Never rewrite code that has already been written.

	I like that idea a LOT, if you spend some time looking around, the problem you have has probably already been solved

Avoid Captive User Interfaces
	I feel like I HALF understand this. When I use the GUI on my windows machine, I am really 
	limited in my ability to work with my computer. I can make scripts to run things only because of the command line. If I had a program that didn't have that option it would be almost impossible to automate anything that the programmer didnt want me to automate.
Make Every Program a Filter
	Not really sure what they mean by this, they explained in the article I read, but it looks kinda technical
